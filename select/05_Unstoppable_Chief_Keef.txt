My leather so soft, shells so hard
You wanna be a boss nigga go hard
Call me lil glo I come through and dim your yard
I got coco baby like damn so hard
Go in my closet pick some straps out the arsenal
I got on trues but these bullets fly like envelops
Blood gang ride through hop out like whats poppin' tho?

Tadoe in the cut, slick on the roof tho
Lay these bullets on yo ass straight sumo

You wanna be a boss nigga go hard
Call me lil glo I come through and dim your yard

Go in my closet pick some straps out the arsenal
I got on trues but these bullets fly like envelops
Blood gang ride through hop out like whats poppin' tho?
