Sheltered in there since the fateful flight
Crafted den, seething with these dreams alive
The shadow will no more withdraw
Wicked time has frozen in a dusky dawn
Daylight will never be reaching noon
Marvel and despair of a world
Dressing not anymore in its cloak of gloom
Nothing hinders the will
Nor suffers delay
Time is standing still
As nothing more stands in the way
Even if he claims
Only joy remains
Even quite alone
In a savage run
The ones that might slow the haste
Are fated to be hushed
The ones that try to stop the race
Deserve to be crushed
Under a mask of conceit and pride
Badly armed with some tricks and a cunning mind
The harmless faced the foe unnamed
Played the part of a cruel unfair game
And killed, destroyed the grim enemy grown
Only one tremor for a wrong
Buried under a bunch of stillborn hopes
Nothing hinders the will
Nor suffers delay
Time is standing still
As nothing more stands in the way
Even if he claims
Only joy remains
Even quite alone
In a savage run
