I am the ugly in every man
And I am a victim of circumstance
And I am another animal
When I'm locked and loaded I'm-
Unstoppable
Unstoppable
I'll handle this, I'll handle this, I'll handle this now
Read my lips, I'll never quit, I'll never quit, now
Light the fire in my head
You can try but you can't hide because
I am the ugly in every man
And I am a victim of circumstance
And I am another animal
When I'm locked and loaded I'm-
Unstoppable
Unstoppable
You can bet, you can bet, you can bet, yeah
You'll regret, you'll regret, you'll regret your-
You're playing with my head
You can try but you can't hide because
I am the ugly in every man
And I am a victim of circumstance
And I am another animal
When I'm locked and loaded I'm-
Unstoppable
I-I (I'm unstoppable)
I-I-I (I'm unstoppable)
I-I-I (I'm unstoppable)
I-I-I (am I unstoppable?)
I am the ugly in every man
And I am a victim of circumstance
And I am another animal
When I'm locked and loaded I'm-
Unstoppable
I am the ugly in every man
And I am a victim of circumstance
And I am another animal
When I'm locked and loaded I'm-
Unstoppable
Unstoppable
Unstoppable
I'm unstoppable
